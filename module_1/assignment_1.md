# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

When learning data analytics, ChatGPT can help by being a quick reference tool. I have used it to look up syntax and to ask it for definitions for different terminology. In this class, I expect that I will also use it to know what questions to ask when looking at data, and how to do certain things in Excel and SQL.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.
 

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
 
While the explanation worked, it took some clicking around to figure out where exactly I was supposed to sort. Maybe I should have been more specific when asking Chat GPT and told it that I’m an Excel newbie. It would have been helpful for Chat GPT to clarify that the sorting would not be happening in the pivot table section.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
 
    While the Google result was more detailed, I also found it more confusing. I’ve found that when trying to find out how to do things in Excel, it’s hard to find blog posts or videos that show the version of Excel I’m currently using, which makes them hard to follow.

I liked how clear all the screenshots were with their corresponding arrows. Point to me like one of your French girls please.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?

  

I asked both Google and Chat GPT how to remove duplicates in a dataset, and once again found Chat GPT to be more helpful. Though Google “showed its work” and had a ton of links I could go to, it was much easier to follow Chat GPT. Maybe it’s because I have trained Chat GPT to explain things to me like I’m five.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information

- 
I think Chat GPT is best when I need to have some back and forth when I’m asking a question. Google doesn’t talk back quite as well. 
I think Google works better when you’re trying to find the why and not just the what because you’re able to dig deeper and go down link rabbit holes. This can be good or bad depending on how confident you want to be, how well you want to understand a concept, or how much time you have to dig into something.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

I continue to be a Chat GPT stan. While I think there’s a ton of value in Google’s Search, I find their new AI Overview function super tedious and ugly, to the point that I have avoided using Google so that I don’t have that come up on my screen. 

However, I do think that Google might be a better place to find additional resources to learn complicated subjects, so I might mainly use it to find like to other sites I want to visit.
